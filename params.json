Beta testers are more than welcome.\r\n\r\n# Luxun\r\n\r\n\r\nA high-throughput, distributed, publish-subscribe messaging system. Luxun is inspired by [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/). The main design objectives of Luxun are the following:\r\n\r\n1. ***Fast***: close to the speed of direct memory access, both produding and consuming are close to O(1) memory access.\r\n2. ***Persistent*** : all data in the system is persisted on disk and is crash resistant.\r\n3. ***High-throughput***: even with modest hardware Luxun can support handreds of thousands of messages per second.\r\n4. ***Realtime*** : messages produced by producer threads should be immediately visible to consumer threads.\r\n5. ***Distributed*** : explicit support for partitioning messages over Luxun servers and distributing consumption over a cluster of consumer machines while maintaining per-partition ordering semantics.\r\n6. ***Multiple clients support*** : use [Thrift RPC](http://thrift.apache.org/) as communication infrastructure, easy to generate different clients for different platforms.\r\n7. ***Flexible consuming semantics*** : supports typical consume once queue, fan out queue, even supports consume by index when needed.\r\n\r\nThe objectives above makes Luxun extremely suitable for nowadays popular big data or activity stream collecting and analytics.\r\n\r\nLuxun is based on the [bigqueue](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bigqueue) library which uses [memory mapped file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_mapped_file) internally to support fast while persistent queue operations.\r\n\r\n## The Architecture\r\n\r\n![The Architecture](http://bulldog2011.github.com/images/luxun/arch-2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version History\r\n#### 0.6.0 â€” *March 25, 2013* : [repository](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bulldog-repo/tree/master/repo/releases/com/leansoft/luxun/0.6.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n## Docs\r\n\r\n1.

[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/index.html), a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system using Scala as implementation language.\r\n2. [Jafka](https://github.com/adyliu/jafka), a Kafka clone using Java as implementation language.\r\n3. [Java Chronicel](https://github.com/peter-lawrey/Java-Chronicle), an ultra low latency, high throughput, persisted, messaging and event driven in memory database. using memory mapped file and index based access mode, implemented in Java.\r\n4. [fqueue](http://code.google.com/p/fqueue/), fast and persistent queue based on memory mapped file and paging algorithm, implemented in Java.\r\n5. [ashes-queue](http://code.google.com/p/ashes-queue/), FIFO queue based on memory mapped file and paging algorithm, implemented in Java.\r\n6. [Kestrel](https://github.com/robey/kestrel), a simple, distributed message queue system implemented in Scala, supporting reliable, loosely ordered message queue.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the authors of these open source projects!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Origin of the Name\r\nBoth [Franz Kafka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) and [Lu Xun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) lived almost in the same era, similar to Kafka, Lu Xun was a great Chinese writer. In spite of their differences, Kafka and Lu Xun share a common concern on what they saw as the oppressive nature of the past and the authority drawn from it.\r\n\r\nLuxun messaging system is named after Lu Xun, in memorial of his great contributions to Chinese literature.\r\n![Luxun](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/LuXun1930.jpg/200px-LuXun1930.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
